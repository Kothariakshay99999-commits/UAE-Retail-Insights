# Presentation Script (2–4 minutes)

## Slide 1 — What is Promo Pulse?
Promo Pulse helps UAE retailers make safer promotional decisions despite messy data.

## Slide 2 — Why this matters
Promotions can cost millions. Bad data causes wrong decisions.
So we show dirty vs clean data and log every fix (audit trail).

## Slide 3 — Pipeline
1) Generate dirty data (products/stores/sales/inventory)
2) Validate + clean (issues.csv)
3) Simulate promo uplift with constraints:
   - Budget cap
   - Margin floor
   - Inventory limits

## Slide 4 — Dashboard
Executives see KPIs and trends.
Managers see operational stock risks and drivers.

## Slide 5 — Demo flow
Open Streamlit → check issues log → select city/channel/category → run promo scenario → verify constraints.
